üó∫Ô∏è Project Overview
This is a real-time crowd detection and tourism optimization system designed to assist tourists and authorities in monitoring and managing crowd density at popular locations. The frontend is a React-based web app that overlays real-time crowd data on maps, helping users make informed travel decisions. The backend is built on Google Cloud Platform using services like Pub/Sub for data streaming, Dataflow/Cloud Functions for processing synthetic crowd data, and BigQuery/Firestore for optional historical storage. The system integrates Google Maps API for visualization and is scalable, cloud-native, and user-friendly.
